# Baseball-Awards

Baseball-Awards is a simple SQL project that takes in baseball player and team information and provides awards based on certain crtieria.
I used PostgreSQL through the Postbird client for this project.

Project was developed through Codecademy: https://www.codecademy.com/paths/design-databases-with-postgresql/tracks/what-can-i-do-with-a-database/modules/querying-baseball-data-off-platform-project/informationals/off-platform-project-baseball-through-the-years

Tables were developed by Sean Lahman (His readme is provided in the TheBestofBaseballAwards folder.
